# final_project
I don't know what I want to do yet.

Option 1. - Happy Hour Website
  This one will be a directory of New York City happy hours...

    -Users can search based on location, price, if there's food. 

    -Bars/Happy Hour locations can sign in and change their menu's specials, etc.

  Obviously New York is huge so I'd have to start small, maybe Brookyln.

Option 2. - Farmers' Market Guide
  This one will be a guide on farmers' markets. It will break down farmers markets, and then vendors, and in vendors, the artisinal items they sell. 

    -Users will be able to search by vendors, artisinal items, and area. 

    -Vendors will be able to log in and add themselves to whichever Farmer's market they'll be selling their items for the week/month.

Option 3. - Skateboarding Website
  My friends have a terrible website that they asked me to fix (they must be desperate). The only reason I've been considering doing it as my final project is because it actually requires a lot of features. Primaily athlete pages which they want to be interactive in some kind of way, an e-commerce store front, and something that pulls updates from their social media pages and also provides updates on this huge skatepark public they have, since it floods like twice a year.

    -Users can log in an read bios and see photos/videos of their favorite athletes

    -Users can buy items from the brand

    -Users can view company updates

    -Users can check the site for updates for the brand's local skateparks
